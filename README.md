üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: My exciting journey begins with meticulous data cleaning and SEO-friendly preprocessing. I meticulously bid farewell to irrelevant columns, master handling missing values, and unleash the power of categorical-to-numerical transformation. Witness the magic of techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding! For instance, 'Age' is transformed into binary (0 for '<35' and 1 for '>35'), and 'EdLevel' into numerical (0 for 'NoHigherEd,' 1 for 'Other,' 2 for 'Undergraduate,' and 3 for 'Master'). 'Country' undergoes Label Encoding, while the 'HaveWorkedWith' column's tech wizardry results in multiple binary columns, each showcasing a unique technology.

üìà Logistic Regression Magic: In the second part of this exciting journey, I dive into the heart of my project‚Äîbuilding a Logistic Regression model. This model harnesses the power of data to predict an individual's employment status based on various features. My dataset undergoes a smart split into a training set and a test set, with 'Employed' as the star of the show. Watch the model training on the training set and unveiling its prediction prowess on the test set.

‚ú® Accuracy Unleashed: The moment of truth arrives as I evaluate the model's performance using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics. Drumroll, please! My model proudly flaunts an accuracy score of 1.0, signifying its flawless prediction of employment status among individuals in the test set.

üöÄ Key Takeaways: My project is not just about data preprocessing and Logistic Regression; it's a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making. It showcases my technical prowess in crafting a robust model and also sheds light on the critical factors that influence an individual's employment status. Are you ready to explore the data-driven HR landscape and harness the power of predictive analytics?

üåê Web App for Prediction: My Python script utilizes Streamlit, a powerful web application framework, to create an interactive and SEO-optimized user-friendly experience. With this app, you can input employee details and receive instant predictions regarding their hiring status. I've seamlessly integrated the machine learning model into the app, ensuring that you can harness its predictive capabilities effortlessly.
