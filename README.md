üîç Unlocking HR Insights: Data-Driven Analysis with Python üìä

Join us on a journey through the world of Human Resources data analysis using Python and cutting-edge data science libraries. Our dataset is a treasure trove of employee information, encompassing vital factors such as age, education level, years of coding experience, country of residence, technology expertise, and employment status.

üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Our first stop involves meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. We bid farewell to irrelevant columns, master handling missing values, and unleash the power of categorical-to-numerical transformation. Witness the magic of techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding! For instance, we turn 'Age' into binary (0 for '<35' and 1 for '>35'), and 'EdLevel' into numerical (0 for 'NoHigherEd,' 1 for 'Other,' 2 for 'Undergraduate,' and 3 for 'Master'). 'Country' gets its makeover with Label Encoding, while the 'HaveWorkedWith' column's tech wizardry results in multiple binary columns, each showcasing a unique technology.

üìà Logistic Regression Magic: In the second part, we dive into the heart of our project‚Äîbuilding a Logistic Regression model. This model harnesses the power of data to predict an individual's employment status based on various features. Our dataset undergoes a smart split into a training set and a test set, with 'Employed' as the star of the show. Watch the model training on the training set and unveiling its prediction prowess on the test set.

‚ú® Accuracy Unleashed: The moment of truth arrives as we evaluate the model's performance using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics. Drumroll, please! The model proudly flaunts an accuracy score of 1.0, signifying its flawless prediction of employment status among individuals in the test set.

üöÄ Key Takeaways: Our project is a testament to the art of data preprocessing and the might of Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks. It not only showcases technical prowess but also sheds light on the factors that steer an individual's employment status.
