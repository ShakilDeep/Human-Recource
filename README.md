üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Our first stop involves meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. We bid farewell to irrelevant columns, master handling missing values, and unleash the power of categorical-to-numerical transformation. Witness the magic of techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding! For instance, we turn 'Age' into binary (0 for '<35' and 1 for '>35'), and 'EdLevel' into numerical (0 for 'NoHigherEd,' 1 for 'Other,' 2 for 'Undergraduate,' and 3 for 'Master'). 'Country' gets its makeover with Label Encoding, while the 'HaveWorkedWith' column's tech wizardry results in multiple binary columns, each showcasing a unique technology.

üìà Logistic Regression Magic: In the second part, we dive into the heart of our project‚Äîbuilding a Logistic Regression model. This model harnesses the power of data to predict an individual's employment status based on various features. Our dataset undergoes a smart split into a training set and a test set, with 'Employed' as the star of the show. Watch the model training on the training set and unveiling its prediction prowess on the test set.

‚ú® Accuracy Unleashed: The moment of truth arrives as we evaluate the model's performance using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics. Drumroll, please! The model proudly flaunts an accuracy score of 1.0, signifying its flawless prediction of employment status among individuals in the test set.

üöÄ Key Takeaways: Our project is a testament to the art of data preprocessing and the might of Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks. It not only showcases technical prowess but also sheds light on the factors that steer an individual's employment status. Are you ready to explore the data-driven HR landscape and harness the power of predictive analytics?

But that's not all! We've taken this data analysis journey a step further by creating a web application that allows you to predict employee hiring outcomes with ease.

üåê Web App for Prediction: Our Python script utilizes Streamlit, a powerful web application framework, to create an interactive and user-friendly experience. With this app, you can input employee details and receive instant predictions regarding their hiring status. We've integrated the machine learning model seamlessly into the app, ensuring that you can harness its predictive capabilities effortlessly.

üîç Data Integration: The script defines functions for generating additional features to match the model's expected input and preprocessing the input data to fit the model's requirements. This ensures that the predictions are accurate and reliable, allowing you to make informed HR decisions.
